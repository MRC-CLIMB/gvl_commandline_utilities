<p>Scripts useful for users of GVL cloud images (CloudMan instances).
These scripts configure GVL instances as command-line bioinformatics platforms, including RStudio and IPython Notebook setup.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-run-these-scripts" class="anchor" href="#how-to-run-these-scripts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to run these scripts</h2>

<p>To use, launch a GVL instance ( <a href="http://launch.genome.edu.au/">http://launch.genome.edu.au/</a> ), ssh in as user ubuntu, and run</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/claresloggett/gvl_commandline_utilities
cd gvl_commandline_utilities
sh run_all.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This version of gvl_commandline_utilities is intended to run on GVL image v2.20 or later.
Some of the scripts are dependent on the correct config hooks being available in
/usr/nginx/conf/nginx.conf .</p>

<p>The main scripts you are likely to want to run yourself are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>run_all.sh</code> : configure your instance for command-line use and install services.</li>
<li>
<code>setup_user.sh</code> : after running <code>run_all.sh</code>, can be run again to configure additional user accounts.</li>
<li>
<code>toolshed_to_modules.py</code> : after running <code>run_all.sh</code>, can be run again to update module files. This is useful if tools have been added or removed using the Galaxy Toolshed.</li>
<li>
<code>galaxy-fuse.py</code> : an ordinary user can run this script to set up access to their Galaxy Datasets, if they have a Galaxy account.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="how-to-use-installed-features" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-installed-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use installed features</h2>

<p>Running <code>run_all.sh</code> will create a non-sudo account called "researcher", with various services configured.
It is more secure and convenient to use the researcher account for ordinary research activities, but
to carry out admin actions, you will need to use a sudoer account such as ubuntu.</p>

<p>To access the below features, ssh in as user researcher, or if you are already logged in as ubuntu,
just</p>

<pre><code>su researcher
cd
</code></pre>

<p>This will get you to your home directory.</p>

<p>You can then find documentation on most of the features described on this page by examining the
README.txt file in your home directory:</p>

<pre><code>less ~/README.txt
</code></pre>

<p>To access specific services, including those that come pre-installed on GVL instances:</p>

<p><strong>CloudMan</strong> is already installed, without running these scripts.
It is accessible at</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/cloud
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VNC, for remote desktop access</strong> is already installed, without running these scripts.
It is accessible at</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/vnc
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Galaxy</strong> is already installed, without running these scripts. The Galaxy application directory
can be found via the symlink <code>~/galaxy</code>, and Galaxy is accessible at</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Galaxy-installed reference genomes</strong>, as well as genome indices created by Galaxy-installed
tools, can be accessed by command-line users via the symlink <code>~/galaxy_genomes</code> .
Unless configured otherwise, this directory tree will be mounted using a shared filesystem and
therefore read-only.</p>

<p><strong>Galaxy Datasets</strong> can be mounted for direct read access using the galaxy-fuse script,
which can be found in your home directory at <code>~/galaxy-fuse.py</code>. You will need your Galaxy API key,
found by logging into Galaxy and selecting the menu option User -&gt; API Keys.
To use, run</p>

<pre><code>python galaxy-fuse.py galaxy_files &lt;api-key&gt; &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>This puts the galaxy-fuse process into the background. <code>galaxy_files</code> can be replaced
by any desired mountpoint. After running the above command, Galaxy Datasets will
appear as read-only files, organised by History, under the directory galaxy_files.</p>

<p>See the notes on the <code>galaxy-fuse.py</code> script below for caveats.</p>

<p>A per-user <strong>web-accessible folder</strong> can be found at <code>~/public_html</code> . Any files you place in this
directory will be <em>publicly</em> accessible at</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/public/researcher/&lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you create extra user accounts using <code>setup_user.sh</code>, each account will get a similar folder which redirects
to a URL as above, with <code>researcher</code> replaced by the relevant username.</p>

<p><strong>RStudio</strong> is accessible at</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/rstudio/
</code></pre>

<p>You can log into RStudio with username "researcher" and the corresponding linux password.
Any other linux accounts created by running <code>setup_user.sh</code> will similarly have RStudio accounts.</p>

<p>An <strong>IPython Notebook</strong> profile has been created for running a password-protected notebook
server over the web. It does not run by default - it must be launched by a user such as researcher.
You can launch IPython Notebook by changing to any desired working directory and running</p>

<pre><code>ipython notebook --profile=nbserver
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the server to run while you are logged out, you may want
to enter a screen session first by running <code>screen</code>. The next time you log in,
you can reconnect to it using <code>screen -r</code>.</p>

<p>To access the running ipython notebook, point your browser to:</p>

<pre><code>https://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/ipython/
</code></pre>

<p>Note the https in the URL!
You will need the password you entered during setup.
Your connection will be encrypted. If you use the current default setup you will
see a browser warning due to the self-signed certificate - this is expected.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows the password to your notebook server will be able to execute
arbitrary code under your account, so keep this password private. You should treat
it as you would your ssh login credentials.</p>

<p>Under the default configuration, only ONE user can run IPython Notebook at a time.
If you have multiple users, you may want to alter your config.</p>

<p><strong>Tools installed as part of CloudBioLinux</strong> will be in the usual locations for binaries,
and usually already in your path.</p>

<p><strong>Tools installed by the Galaxy Toolshed</strong> will not be in your path and multiple versions
of some tools may be available. Environment modules (<a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net/">http://modules.sourceforge.net/</a>) have been created
and will give access to most installed Galaxy Toolshed tools. You can see available Toolshed-installed
tools by running</p>

<pre><code>module avail
</code></pre>

<p>Refer to the <code>module</code> documentation for instructions on loading, viewing and unloading modules.
If Toolshed tools have been added or removed, rerunning <code>toolshed_to_modules.py</code> as
described below will update the environment modules.</p>

<p>Consult <a href="http://www.genome.edu.au/">http://www.genome.edu.au/</a> for further documentation on GVL instances.</p>

<h3>
<a name="run_allsh" class="anchor" href="#run_allsh"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>run_all.sh</h3>

<p>Run other scripts with correct ordering and permissions.</p>

<p>Any utilities which need to be configured for all users will be configured.</p>

<p>An ordinary user account called "researcher" will be created for non-admin use,
and configured with per-user utilities.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>sh run_all.sh
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="toolshed_to_modulespy" class="anchor" href="#toolshed_to_modulespy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>toolshed_to_modules.py</h3>

<p>Look for the env.sh scripts used to set up the environment for Galaxy Toolshed-installed
tools, and use these to create module files. The resulting modules can be accessed
using environment module commands such as <code>module avail</code> (see
<a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net/man/module.html">http://modules.sourceforge.net/man/module.html</a>). Different modules should be available for
different installed versions of the same tool.</p>

<p>If a Toolshed-installed tool is uninstalled from Galaxy, running this script should
clean up the module file.</p>

<p>Usage (show help):</p>

<pre><code>sudo -E python toolshed_to_modules.py -h
</code></pre>

<p>Requires superuser permissions, and makes use of environment variables specifying module
locations.</p>

<h3>
<a name="configure_nginxsh" class="anchor" href="#configure_nginxsh"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>configure_nginx.sh</h3>

<p>Set up NGINX config file structure necessary to configure RStudio, public_html, and
IPython Notebook.</p>

<p>This script is intended to run on GVL image v2.19 or later. It assumes that the
placeholder config files commandline_utilities_http.conf and
commandline_utilities_https.conf have been configured into /usr/nginx/conf/nginx.conf .</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>sudo sh configure_nginx.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Requires superuser permissions.</p>

<h3>
<a name="setup_rstudiosh" class="anchor" href="#setup_rstudiosh"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>setup_rstudio.sh</h3>

<p>Install and configure RStudio. This will create a group called rstudio_users, which
ordinary user accounts will be added to by <code>setup_user.sh</code>. RStudio will be available
at <code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/rstudio/</code></p>

<p>To use run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo setup_rstudio.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Requires superuser permissions. Assumes that configure_nginx.sh has been run.</p>

<h3>
<a name="setup_usersh" class="anchor" href="#setup_usersh"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>setup_user.sh</h3>

<p>Run all scripts below which apply to an individual user. This script can be run multiple
times to create and configure multiple non-sudo user accounts.</p>

<p>It will create the user account, add it to appropriate groups, and configure symlinks
and services, and set passwords.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>sh setup_user.sh &lt;username&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="setup_ipython_serverpy" class="anchor" href="#setup_ipython_serverpy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>setup_ipython_server.py</h3>

<p>Configure an ipython notebook profile to run the ipython notebook server including
password-protection and SSL encryption. The notebook server, when running, will be
available at <code>http://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;/ipython/</code></p>

<p>This script does not require sudo and can be run by an individual user to configure
IPython Notebook under their account. It should <em>not</em> be run by the suduer account ubuntu,
as it is dangerous to launch a notebook server from this account.</p>

<p>Usage (as the appropriate user):</p>

<pre><code>python setup_ipython_server.py
</code></pre>

<p>This script assumes that configure_nginx.sh has been run to set up the appropriate
port forwarding. Note that under the default config, only ONE user can run IPython
Notebook at any one time. More advanced configurations are possible which allow multiple
instances to be served up at different addresses or different ports.</p>

<h3>
<a name="add_public_htmlsh" class="anchor" href="#add_public_htmlsh"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>add_public_html.sh</h3>

<p>Create a public_html directory and redirect for the specified user.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>sudo sh add_public_html.sh &lt;username&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Requires superuser permissions. Assumes that <code>configure_nginx.sh</code> has been run.</p>

<h3>
<a name="galaxy-fusepy" class="anchor" href="#galaxy-fusepy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>galaxy-fuse.py</h3>

<p>This script can be found in the home directory of each ordinary user, e.g. at
<code>~researcher/galaxy-fuse.py</code>. It is <em>not</em> called as part of the setup process by <code>run_all.sh</code>.</p>

<p>To use this, you should log in as an ordinary user (e.g. <code>researcher</code>). You will
need your Galaxy API key, found by logging into Galaxy and selecting the menu
option User -&gt; API Keys. You can mount your Galaxy Datasets using a command like</p>

<pre><code>python galaxy-fuse.py galaxy_files &lt;api-key&gt; &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>This puts the galaxy-fuse process into the background. <code>galaxy_files</code> can be replaced
by any desired mountpoint. After running the above command, Galaxy Datasets will
appear as read-only files, organised by History, under the directory galaxy_files.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Galaxy Datasets will be read-only, since writing to them directly is not supported
by the Galaxy API</li>
<li>Datasets with non-unique names will not work</li>
<li>History or Dataset names containing a slash (/) are escaped to '%-'</li>
